# AEX/3
AEX/3 is an operating system-like thing written in Lua. It is aimed to be able to run on many platforms that support Lua. At the moment, the only stable and recommended environment is Starfall on Garry's Mod. 

The organization of the build-related things might be a nightmare because this is my first public repository.

# Building
At the moment the building of AEX/3 requires some things that I'm not sure if are complete enough to be released into the public. 

If you'd like to see AEX/3 running on Garry's Mod, please [add me on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lub13h4lfl1f31gr4mwg0/) and message me.

# Feedback
I'm pretty open to hearing feedback about AEX/3. Feedback from other users can improve AEX/3 greatly.
