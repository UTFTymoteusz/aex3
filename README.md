# AEX/3
AEX/3 is an operating system-like thing written in Lua. It is aimed to be able to run on many platforms that support Lua. At the moment, the only working and recommended environment is Starfall on Garry's Mod. 

The organization of the build-related things might be a nightmare because this is my first public repository.

At the moment if you'd like to see AEX/3 running on Garry's Mod, please [add me on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lub13h4lfl1f31gr4mwg0/) and message me.
